Hello. <p>
I am a Japanese woman. Though I am over 60 years old, I tried to learn Django and have programed through the Django girls project. So this blog is  an example of Django Girls. I remember I was a girl fifty years ago.  
But, what do I write here?    ...............let me think................  
</p>

<p>I have been collecting labels on some products, tickets, and cards whose designs or motifs I liked. They are valueless, but I like them because I have special memories with them. I am going to show them on my blog for myself. 
Someday, I will add search and classification functions.
